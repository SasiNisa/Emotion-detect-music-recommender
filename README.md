## 🔹 Project Overview

This web application allows users to **upload an image**, detects the **emotion** of the person using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, and then **recommends songs** based on the detected emotion. Each recommended song includes a link to watch it on **YouTube**.  

The system demonstrates integration of **Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Web Development** in a user-friendly interface.
